# Alphabot_webServer
## General description of the project

This is our second project with the alphabot.
It is a web-app written in python using Flask and a database (SQLite) where we save some information (for example who did a move).

## HTML pages
There are two HTML pages: the first for the login and then the page with all the commands to make the Alphabot move.
The first page contains a form where you have to put a username and a password to be consequently directed to the second page (the username and password are saved on a database).
The second page contains some buttons with the elementals moves (forward, backward, left and right) and a space where you can enter a complex command that will be executed by the alphabot (this is also saved on the database).

## Cookies
We use cookies to save the username of the user who made the alphabot move and then save the username, time and move made in the database.
